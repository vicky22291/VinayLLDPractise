# Design a Concurrent Scheduled Task Executor (Cron-like Scheduler)

## Question

Design a scheduling service that allows tasks to be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals (like a simplified Cron). 
The service should support one-time tasks and recurring tasks (fixed-rate or fixed-delay), handle task priorities and timing collisions, and run multiple tasks concurrently when possible. 
How would you structure the scheduler’s components (task storage, timer triggers, worker threads) and ensure the system scales and remains efficient under many scheduled tasks? 

## Clarification:

1. This question examines the design of a task scheduler with concurrency and resource management aspects. 
2. A strong answer will propose maintaining a data structure (e.g. a min-heap or priority queue) of upcoming tasks keyed by next execution time. 
3. The scheduler might run a dedicated timer thread that always picks the next due task from the heap and dispatches it. 
4. To allow concurrency, the candidate should suggest a worker pool or thread pool to execute tasks in parallel, up to a limit .
5. This ensures multiple tasks can run at once while controlling CPU usage.
6. They should address synchronization in updating the task schedule (e.g. adding or canceling tasks while the scheduler is running) so that the timing heap is thread-safe. 
7. Scalability considerations include how to handle thousands of scheduled tasks (efficient time checks) and distributing tasks if needed. 
8. Fault-tolerance might involve catching exceptions in tasks so one failing job doesn’t crash the scheduler, and possibly persisting tasks to recover from a restart.
9. The candidate should also cover extensibility – for example, supporting new scheduling policies or task types without redesign.
10. An implementation outline could involve classes like Scheduler (manages the time-based queue of tasks) and WorkerPool (a fixed number of threads executing tasks). 
11. The interviewer will expect discussion of how the scheduler thread coordinates with worker threads (perhaps using a condition variable or timer to wait until the next task is due), and how to handle concurrent modifications (locking around the task heap). 
12. Emphasis should be on a design that is correct under concurrency (no race conditions in scheduling) and efficient in triggering tasks on time.
